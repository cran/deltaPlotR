- Changes in deltaPlotR 1.3 (2013-07-22) -
------------------------------------------

MINOR UPDATES

  o  A warning message has been added when the 
     proportions of corerct responses (or Delta scores)
     are constant in at least one of the groups of
     respondents. In this case the perpendicular 
     distances cannot be computed (since variances are
     equal to zero). This is highly practically 
     implausible but this would lead to an error message. 
     Many thanks to an anonymous reviewer who pointed 
     out this issue.
  o  Some typos were fixed.

- Changes in deltaPlotR 1.2 (2013-07-08) -
------------------------------------------

MINOR UPDATES

  o  A warning message has been added to avoid using the
     'prop' or 'delta' value of the 'type' argument when
     the full item response matrix is provided to the
     'data' argument.
  o  Several references were updated.
  o  Some typos were fixed.

- Changes in deltaPlotR 1.1 (2012-08-08) -
------------------------------------------

MINOR UPDATES

  o  Some typos were corrected in the DESCRIPTION file.
  o  The CITATION file was updated to correct the package
     name, which was leading to an error when calling for
     citation within the R console.
  o  Several references were updated.
